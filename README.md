# Sentiment Analysis of Henry VIII's Love Letters to Anne Boleyn

This project focuses on analysing the sentiment and emotional content of King Henry VIII's love letters to Anne Boleyn, his second wife. By applying natural language processing techniques and sentiment analysis using Python and the NLTK library, this project aims to uncover the emotional dynamics and themes present in these historical love letters.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of 18 love letters written by Henry VIII to Anne Boleyn, obtained from Project Gutenberg. The letters offer a fascinating glimpse into their passionate and complex relationship, which had a significant impact on English history.

## Dependencies

To run the code and reproduce the analysis, you'll need the following dependencies:

- Python
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- pandas
- matplotlib
- wordcloud

## Files

The repository contains the following files:

- `sentiment_analysis.py`: The main Python script that performs sentiment analysis on the love letters.
- `data/`: Directory containing the text files of Henry VIII's love letters to Anne Boleyn.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Results

The sentiment analysis reveals that the majority of Henry VIII's love letters to Anne Boleyn have high positive sentiment scores, reflecting his deep love, affection, and devotion towards her. The most common words in the letters, such as "love," "heart," "trust," and "servant," further emphasise the passionate and intimate nature of their relationship.

The project also includes visualisations, such as sentiment scores over time, top 30 most common words, and a word cloud, to provide a comprehensive understanding of the emotional content and themes in the letters.
